New York Stock Exhange Predictions RNN-LSTM

To train a model to get the prediction of "New York Stock Exchange" with respect to time further ahead

We here has the value of 2016 whole year

Dataset consists of following files:

prices.csv: raw, as-is daily prices. Most of data spans from 2010 to the end 2016, for companies new on stock market date range is shorter. There have been approx. 140 stock splits in that time, this set doesn't account for that.

prices-split-adjusted.csv: same as prices, but there have been added adjustments for splits.

securities.csv: general description of each company with division on sectors

fundamentals.csv: metrics extracted from annual SEC 10K fillings (2012-2016), should be enough to derive most of popular fundamental indicators.

Lstm

Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) which maintains a cell state as well as a carry for ensuring that the signal (information in the form of a gradient) is not lost as the sequence is processed. At each time step the LSTM considers the current word, the carry, and the cell state.

--------------------
GRU RNN

The GRU is the newer generation of Recurrent Neural networks and is pretty similar to an LSTM. GRUâ€™s got rid of the cell state and used the hidden state to transfer information. It also only has two gates, a reset gate and update gate.
